```

## R Markdown

This will be info on what we've done at Animove. 

Here are all the packages to install: 
install.packages(c("moveVis","pbs","dplyr","RStoolbox","move","ggmap","TwoStepCLogit","pbs","dplyr",'lubridate","fdrtool","circular","CircStats"),dependencies = T)

```{r cars}
library(moveVis)
get_imconvert
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
